**FlowMind** is a next-generation diagramming tool that bridges the gap between AI-generated visualization and precise, code-based editing. Designed for developers, architects, and product managers, FlowMind allows you to create complex flowcharts, sequence diagrams, and system architectures using natural language or our specialized DSL.

## Why FlowMind?

Traditional diagramming tools often force a choice between:
1.  **Drag-and-drop tools**: Easy to start, but hard to maintain and version control.
2.  **Code-based tools (like Mermaid)**: Great for versioning, but can be tedious to write from scratch.

FlowMind gives you the best of both worlds. You can start with a text prompt to generate an initial structure, then refine it using our **Hybrid Editor**—manipulating nodes visually on the canvas *or* editing the underlying code directly.

## Key Features

### AI-Powered Generation
Simply describe your system: *"Create a login flow with OAuth fallback and error handling."* FlowMind's Gemini integration scaffolds the entire diagram effectively instantly.

### Hybrid Canvas
Our canvas isn't just a static image. It's a fully interactive graph environment.
*   **Drag & Drop**: Move nodes, auto-snap alignment.
*   **Smart Layouts**: One-click re-organization using Elk.js.
*   **Properties Panel**: Fine-tune specific node styling without touching CSS.

### Diagram-as-Code
Every diagram is backed by a readable, editable JSON structure and compatible with Mermaid.js syntax. This means your documentation can live alongside your code.

### Premium Aesthetics
Built with a "Design First" code, FlowMind diagrams are presentation-ready by default. No more ugly, default-grey boxes.

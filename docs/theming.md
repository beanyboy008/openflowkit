Customize FlowMind to match your personal preference or brand identity.

## Brand Settings

Navigate to **Settings > Brand Kit** to configure:

*   **Primary Color**: The main accent color for buttons, active states, and focused nodes.
*   **Background**: The canvas background color.
*   **Surface**: The color of panels and sidebars.
*   **Logo**: Upload your own logo to replace the FlowMind icon in the sidebar.

## Dark Mode

FlowMind respects your system preference by default but can be toggled manually in the **General Settings**.

## Export Settings

When exporting images (PNG/SVG):
*   **Transparent Background**: Toggle this if you want to overlay the diagram on slides.
*   **Scale**: Increase scale (e.g., 2x, 3x) for high-resolution printing.
*   **Include Watermark**: You can disable the branding watermark in the export settings.

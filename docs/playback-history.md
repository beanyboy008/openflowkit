FlowMind automatically tracks every change you make. The **Playback** features allows you to travel back in time to review your decision process.

## History Timeline

Click the **Clock Icon** in the top navigation bar to open the History Timeline.

### Version Checkpoints
Every time you perform a significant action (adding a node, changing a color, auto-layout), a "snapshot" is saved.
*   **Undo/Redo**: Uses this same system to jump back and forth (`Cmd+Z`).

## Playback Mode

Press the **Play** button in the History panel to watch a "movie" of your diagram being built from start to finish.
*   **Speed Control**: Adjust playback speed (1x, 2x, 4x).
*   **Scrubbing**: Drag the slider to specific points in time.
*   **Restore**: Found an older version you like better? Click "Restore" to revert the canvas to that state perfectly.

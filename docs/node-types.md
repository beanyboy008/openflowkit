FlowMind supports several specialized node types to handle different diagramming needs.

## 1. Custom Node (Default)

The workhorse of your diagrams. It supports a title, an optional icon, and rich connection handles.
*   **Best for**: Process steps, services, database tables, or general entities.
*   **Features**: Resizable, editable label, support for icons.

## 2. Text Node / Annotation

A lightweight, borderless node used for adding comments or labels to the canvas without affecting the flow structure.
*   **Best for**: Adding sticky notes, section headers, or explanatory text.
*   **Usage**: Select "Text" from the toolbar or press \`T\`.

## 3. Group Node

Container nodes that visually group other nodes together. Moving a group moves all nodes inside it.
*   **Best for**: Visualizing sub-systems, VPCs, or logical boundaries.
*   **Usage**: Select nodes -> Right Click -> "Group Selection".

## 4. Swimlane Node

Vertical or horizontal lanes to organize processes by actor or department.
*   **Best for**: Cross-functional flowcharts.

## 5. Image Node

Embed arbitrary images directly onto the canvas.
*   **Best for**: Adding logos, screenshots, or reference diagrams.
*   **Usage**: Drag and drop an image file directly onto the canvas.

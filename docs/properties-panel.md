The Properties Panel is your control center for customizing individual nodes. It appears on the right side of the screen when you select a node.

## Node Customization

### Label Editing
You can rename any node directly from the panel. The label updates in real-time on the canvas.

### Visual Styling
Make your diagrams pop with custom styles:
*   **Colors**: Choose from a curated palette of semantic colors (Red for danger, Green for success, etc.).
*   **Icons**: Add an icon to any node to make it instantly recognizable. We support the full Lucide React icon library.
*   **Stroke Style**: Toggle between `Solid` and `Dashed` borders (great for representing tentative or future states).

### Layout & Sizing
*   **Width/Height**: Manually set dimensions for pixel-perfect alignment.
*   **Position**: View and edit exact X/Y coordinates.

## Bulk Editing

> [!TIP]
> You can select multiple nodes (`Shift + Click`) to edit them all at once!

When multiple nodes are selected, the Properties Panel will apply changes (like color or icon) to **all** selected nodes.

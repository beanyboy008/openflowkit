This guide will help you create your first diagram in FlowMind in under 2 minutes.

## 1. Create a New Flow

From the Dashboard, click the **"Create New"** button (or press \`Cmd+N\`). You will be taken to a fresh canvas.

## 2. Using AI Generation

The fastest way to start is with a prompt.

1.  Locate the command bar at the bottom of the screen.
2.  Type a description of your flow.
    *   *Example:* "Create a user registration flow that includes email verification and database checks."
3.  Press \`Enter\`.

FlowMind will generate a complete diagram structure for you.

## 3. Editing Nodes

Once generated, you can refine the diagram:

*   **Move**: Click and drag any node to reposition it.
*   **Edit Text**: Double-click a node to change its label.
*   **Connect**: Drag from the handles (dots) on a node's edge to connect it to another node.

## 4. Using Smart Layout

If your diagram gets messy, click the **"Auto Layout"** button in the top toolbar. FlowMind uses the ELK layout engine to automatically organize your nodes into a clean hierarchy.

## 5. Exporting

When you're happy with your flow:

1.  Click the **Export** button in the top right.
2.  Choose your format (PNG, SVG, or JSON).
3.  Download your file.

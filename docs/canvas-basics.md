The FlowMind canvas is an infinite, interactive workspace. Here's how to navigate and manipulate it effectively.

## Navigation

*   **Pan**: specific mouse action (e.g., Hold Space + Drag, or Middle Click + Drag) moves the canvas view.
*   **Zoom**: Use the mouse wheel to zoom in and out.
*   **Fit View**: Press \`Shift + 1\` to fit all nodes within the view.

## Node Operations

### Selecting Nodes
*   **Single Select**: Click a node.
*   **Multi-Select**: Hold \`Shift\` and click multiple nodes, or click and drag a selection box around them.

### Duplicating
Select one or more nodes and press \`Cmd + D\` (Mac) or \`Ctrl + D\` (Windows) to duplicate them.

### Deleting
Select nodes and press \`Backspace\` or \`Delete\`.

## The Mini-Map

The Mini-Map in the bottom right corner gives you a high-level overview of your entire flow. You can drag the viewport box inside the mini-map to quickly navigate large diagrams.

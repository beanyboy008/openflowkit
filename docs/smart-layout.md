FlowMind includes a powerful "Smart Layout" engine powered by **ELK (Eclipse Layout Kernel)**. 

## How it Works

Drawing complex diagrams by hand is tedious. You spend more time ALIGNING boxes than thinking about the logic. 
Smart Layout fixes this by running a force-directed algorithm to automatically arrange your nodes.

### Usage
1.  Click the **Layout** button in the Command Center (or top toolbar).
2.  The engine calculates the optimal position for every node and edge.
3.  The diagram animates smoothly to its new structure.

### Features
*   **Hierarchical Layering**: Perfect for flowcharts and organizational trees.
*   **Collision Detection**: Ensures nodes never overlap.
*   **Edge Routing**: Minimizes line crossings for cleaner readability.

> [!TIP]
> Use Smart Layout after importing a raw Mermaid text or generating a large flow with AI to instantly tidy up the result.

**The Developer-First Diagramming Canvas.**  
Turn **Mermaid**, **Text**, and **Ideas** into beautiful, interactive flowcharts instantly.

FlowMind bridges the gap between **Diagram-as-Code** and visual whiteboarding. It's built for developers who love the speed of typing code but need the flexibility of a drag-and-drop canvas.

## 🌟 Why FlowMind?

Most diagramming tools are either "Code Only" (Mermaid/PlantUML) or "Drag & Drop Only" (draw.io). FlowMind is **both**.

- **📝 Mermaid & DSL Native**: Paste your Mermaid code, and it instantly renders as editable nodes.
- **✨ Beautiful Defaults**: No more ugly charts. FlowMind uses a premium glassmorphic UI with auto-layout.
- **⚡️ Rapid Prototyping**: Text-to-Flow capabilities let you scaffold complex systems in seconds.
- **🧠 AI Copilot**: Stuck? Ask the built-in AI to "Add error handling" or "Explain this flow".

## 🔥 Key Features

### 🛠 Diagram as Code
First-class support for **Mermaid.js** and our own **FlowMind DSL**.
- **Import**: Paste `graph TD; A-->B;` and see it come to life.
- **Export**: Get clean Mermaid, PlantUML, or JSON output for your docs.
- **Live Sync**: Tweaking the visual graph updates the underlying code structure.

### 🎨 Premium UX
- **Glassmorphism UI**: Modern, translucent controls that stay out of your way.
- **Smart Auto-Layout**: One-click cleanup using the Dagre layout engine.
- **Keyboard Power**: `Cmd+K` Command Bar, Figma-like shortcuts, and multi-select.
- **Dark Mode Ready**: (Coming soon) Optimized specifically for long coding sessions.

### 🤖 Intelligent Assistance
While FlowMind is a solid manual tool, it has an AI engine under the hood when you need speed:
- **Text-to-Diagram**: "System architecture for a microservices app" -> *Boom, full diagram.*
- **Contextual Edits**: Select a node and type "Expand this into a login subprocess".

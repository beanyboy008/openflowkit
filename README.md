**The Developer-First Diagramming Canvas.**  
Turn **Mermaid**, **Text**, and **Ideas** into beautiful, interactive flowcharts instantly.

FlowMind bridges the gap between **Diagram-as-Code** and visual whiteboarding. It's built for developers who love the speed of typing code but need the flexibility of a drag-and-drop canvas.

## 🌟 Why FlowMind?

Most diagramming tools are either "Code Only" (Mermaid/PlantUML) or "Drag & Drop Only" (draw.io). FlowMind is **both**.

- **📝 Mermaid & DSL Native**: Paste your Mermaid code, and it instantly renders as editable nodes.
- **🎨 Designed for Figma**: Copy your entire flow and paste it into Figma as **fully editable layers**. Text remains text.
- **✨ Beautiful Defaults**: No more ugly charts. FlowMind uses a premium glassmorphic UI with auto-layout that looks 10x better than standard Mermaid renders.
- **⚡️ Rapid Prototyping**: Text-to-Flow capabilities let you scaffold complex systems in seconds.
- **🧠 AI Copilot**: Stuck? Ask the built-in AI to "Add error handling" or "Explain this flow".

## 🔥 Key Features

### 🖌️ Native Figma Export (New!)
Stop screenshotting your diagrams. FlowMind generates clean, structured SVGs that behave like native Figma layers.
- **Editable Text**: Labels and sublabels export as `<text>` blocks, not paths. Fix typos in Figma without redrawing.
- **Vector Fidelity**: Perfect rounded corners, gradients, and stroke precision.
- **One-Click Copy**: Just hit "Copy for Figma" and paste (Cmd+V).

### 🛠 Advanced Diagram as Code
First-class support for **Mermaid.js** and our own **FlowMind DSL**.
- **Expanded Support**: Now supporting **Flowcharts**, **State Diagrams**, and **Subgraphs** (Groups).
- **Theme Integration**: We map Mermaid's `classDef` and `style` directives to our premium Tailwind-based design system.
- **Import**: Paste `graph TD; A-->B;` or `stateDiagram-v2; [*]-->State1;` and see it come to life.
- **Live Sync**: Tweaking the visual graph updates the underlying code structure.

### 💎 Premium UX & Smart Editor
- **Intelligent Text Nodes**: Multi-line labels with auto-expanding text areas and Markdown support.
- **Design System 2.0**: A completely refreshed UI with glassmorphic controls, consistent iconography, and a refined color palette.
- **Universal Handles**: Omni-directional connection points that just work.
- **Interactive Minimap**: Navigate massive diagrams with ease.

### 📐 Advanced Auto-Layout (New!)
Powered by the **ELK Layout Engine** for professional-grade graph organization.
- **4 Algorithms**: Layered (standard flow), Tree (org charts), Force (organic networks), and Radial.
- **Layout Studio**: Interactive control over direction (TB/LR), spacing density, and node separation.
- **Animated Transitions**: Watch your graph smoothly reorganize itself.

### 🧩 Organization & Structure (New!)
Tame complex systems with powerful grouping tools.
- **Collapsible Groups**: Nest nodes inside containers that can be expanded or collapsed to hide detail.
- **Swimlanes**: Visually segregate processes into functional areas or responsibilities.
- **Smart Routing**: Edges automatically route around obstacles, utilizing orthogonal paths and minimizing crossings. Support for parallel edges and self-loops.

### ⚡️ Productivity Tools
- **Multi-Select & Batch Ops**: Align, distribute, and style multiple nodes simultaneously.
- **Quick Actions**: Double-click canvas to add nodes. Context menus for rapid editing.
- **Command Bar (`Cmd+K`)**: Keyboard-driven navigation for every action in the app.

### 🛡 Reliability & Testing
FlowMind is built for production-grade stability.
- **Unit Testing**: 100% logic coverage for Mermaid and FlowMind DSL parsers.
- **State Integrity**: History (undo/redo) and auto-save logic are strictly validated via Vitest.

## 🏗️ Architecture & Tech Stack

Built for performance and extensibility using the best modern web tech:

- **Core**: [React Flow](https://reactflow.dev/) + [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
- **State Management**: [Zustand](https://zustand-demo.pmnd.rs/) for multi-tab shared state and persistence.
- **Language**: [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for type-safe reliability.
- **Testing**: [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) + [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/)
- **Styling**: [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) with a custom design system.
- **Persistence**: Zustand-powered local storage with automated state synchronization.
- **Modular Components**: Decomposed component architecture for better maintainability (FlowCanvas, CommandBar, TopNav).
- **Format**: Custom manageable DSL for graph persistence + Mermaid parsers.

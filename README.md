## ✨ Key Features

### 🤖 AI-Powered Generation
- **Text-to-Flow**: Describe your process (e.g., "Create a login flow with OAuth and 2FA") and watch it appear.
- **Context-Aware Updates**: Select nodes and ask AI to "Add error handling" or "Simplify this section".
- **Smart Suggestions**: AI understands your current graph context to making relevant additions.

### ⚡ Productivity Tools
- **Node Templates**: Pre-built patterns for common workflows (Auth, CRUD, Approval Chains).
- **Multi-Tab Support**: Work on multiple flows simultaneously within a single session.
- **Auto-Layout**: Instantly organize messy diagrams with Dagre-powered automatic positioning.
- **Sections & Grouping**: Organize complex flows into logical, visual groups.

### 💾 Data & Persistence
- **Auto-Save**: Never lose your work. Changes are automatically saved to local storage.
- **Version Snapshots**: Create named save points (e.g., "v1 - Initial Draft") and restore them anytime.
- **JSON Import/Export**: robust save/load functionality for sharing or backing up flows.

### 🎨 Visual & Export
- **Custom Node Types**: Semantic nodes for Start, Process, Decision, End, and Annotations.
- **Edge Styling**: Semantic edge labels (Yes/No, Success/Error) with automatic styling.
- **Export Options**: 
  - 📸 **PNG Image**: High-resolution export for presentations.
  - 📝 **MermaidJS**: Copy code for Markdown documentation.
  - 🌿 **PlantUML**: Copy code for technical specifications.

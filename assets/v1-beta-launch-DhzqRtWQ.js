const e=`# 🚀 OpenFlowKit V1 Beta: The Future of Diagram-as-Code is Here

We are beyond excited to officially announce the **OpenFlowKit V1 Beta**. What started as a simple flowchart tool has evolved into a comprehensive, white-label diagramming ecosystem designed for developers who demand premium aesthetics and local-first reliability.

This release marks a fundamental shift in our mission: **OpenFlowKit is no longer just an app; it's a foundation for your next project.**

## 🏗️ What's New in V1 Beta?

### 🎨 The Brand Engine (True White-Labeling)
Most diagramming tools force you to look like their product. OpenFlowKit is the first open-source tool built to look like **yours**.
- **Dynamic Palette Generation**: Enter one primary color, and our engine generates a smooth, harmonious design system including surface, background, and accent colors.
- **Typography Integration**: Native Google Fonts support allows you to sync your app's typography directly with the canvas.
- **UI Physics**: Toggle Glassmorphism and adjust border radiuses to match your brand's aesthetic density.

### 📜 Diagram-as-Code (DaC) Second-to-None
We treat diagrams as data. Whether you're a Mermaid.js power user or prefer a custom DSL, we've got you covered.
- **Expanded Mermaid Support**: Full fidelity for Flowcharts, State Diagrams, and Subgraphs.
- **FlowMind DSL**: A human-readable notation designed for rapid prototyping without touching a mouse.
- **Live Sync**: Visual changes and code changes stay perfectly in sync, offering the best of both worlds.

### 💎 Figma Fidelity Export
Stop screenshotting! Our "Figma-First" export strategy ensures your diagrams belong in your design files.
- **Vector Perfection**: Export clean SVGs that maintain stroke precision and rounded corners.
- **Editable Text**: Labels are exported as native SVG text blocks, meaning you can fix typos directly in Figma without redrawing.

### 🔑 Privacy-First AI (BYOK)
AI is powerful, but your data is private. Our **Bring Your Own Key** model puts you in control.
- **Gemini Powered**: Use your own Gemini API key for intelligent diagram generation.
- **Local Storage**: Your API keys are stored locally in your browser and never touch our servers.

### 🖼️ Image-to-Flowchart (Vision AI)
Sketch it, scan it, ship it.
- **Visual Recognition**: Upload a photo of a whiteboard session or napkin sketch.
- **Instant Conversion**: Our AI analyzes the visual structure and converts it into a fully editable, semantic flowchart in seconds.

### 📦 The Library Ecosystem
In addition to the standalone editor, we've extracted OpenFlowKit's core into \`@openflowkit/core\`. This allows developers to embed our state-of-the-art parsers and theming logic into their own applications.

## 🌟 The Philosophy: Premium & Open
We believe that open-source tools shouldn't "look" like open-source tools. OpenFlowKit V1 Beta brings the polish of a billion-dollar SaaS product to the open-source community, 100% free under the MIT license.

## 🛣️ What's Next?
The V1 Beta is just the beginning. We are working on:
- **Collaborative Real-Time Editing** (Yjs/WebRTC).
- **Expanded Component Libraries** for wireframing.
- **Direct Figma Plugin** integration.
